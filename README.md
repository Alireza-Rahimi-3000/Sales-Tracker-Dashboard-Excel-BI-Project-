📌 Project Overview

This project presents a Sales Performance Dashboard built entirely in Microsoft Excel, designed to track and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) for a retail-style business.
The goal was to convert raw transactional data into actionable insights that help decision-makers monitor profitability, sales efficiency, and regional performance in a single, interactive view.

🎯 Objectives

The dashboard was built to answer critical business questions such as:

Which regions and categories are performing best in terms of sales and profit?

How do sales representatives compare in performance ranking?

What is the monthly trend in sales volume and total profit?

What is the completion vs. cancellation rate of transactions?

⚙️ Tools & Techniques

Microsoft Excel (Advanced)

Power Query for data transformation

Power Pivot for modeling and relationships

DAX for calculated KPIs

Interactive slicers for customer type, payment method, and region filters

Dynamic charts and KPI cards for visual storytelling

🗺️ Dashboard Features

Dynamic Filters: Users can filter by region, customer type, and payment method.

KPI Cards: Track real-time Total Profit, Sales by Region, and Average Order Value.

Sales by Month: Highlights seasonal fluctuations and sales peaks.

Top Sellers & Managers Ranking: Compare performance among sales representatives.

Order Completion Breakdown: Visual donut chart showing pending, completed, and canceled orders.

🔍 Insights & Findings

The South region recorded the highest total sales, while the West region achieved the best profit margin.

Home Goods and Sports were the top-performing categories in total revenue.

Order completion rate (47%) revealed potential inefficiencies in order processing or customer follow-up.

Top sellers (Eve, Alice) consistently outperformed peers in both sales quantity and revenue.

🧠 Learnings

This project strengthened my ability to:

Build end-to-end Excel-based BI dashboards

Translate business logic into DAX calculations

Combine data cleaning, analysis, and visualization in a single workflow

Design user-friendly and visually structured dashboards aligned with professional BI design principles

🚀 Future Enhancements

To evolve this Excel dashboard toward mid-senior BI level, I plan to:

Integrate the dataset into Power BI for advanced drill-down interactivity

Automate data refresh via Power Query connection

Add predictive sales trend analysis using Python or SQL integration
